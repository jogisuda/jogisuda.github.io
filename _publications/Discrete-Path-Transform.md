Joint work with the Signal Processing lab at UNESP to develop a novel transform, designed to serve as a new tool for handcrafted feature extraction (FE). It improves the elementary analysis provided by signal energy (E) and enhances the humble spectral investigation granted by zero-crossing rates (ZCR). Python code is presented [here](https://github.com/jogisuda/Discrete-Path-Transform) for both the DPT as well as the inverse transform, IDPT, allowing for perfect reconstruction of the signal.
