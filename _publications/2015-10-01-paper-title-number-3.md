Undergraduate research dissertation at UNESP. A novel index for diagnosis of Keratoconus was proposed, which we called Corneal Tomography Multivariate Index (CTMVI). It uses [Paraconsistent Feature Engineering](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8588433) and Support-Vector Machines to differentiate between healthy and pathological patients, potentially subclinical.
