About me
======

I'm a Physics PhD student at CERN. I wrote the first Brazilian book about Quantum Machine Learning (QML), [free and publicly available](https://github.com/jogisuda/Aprendizado-de-Maquina-Quantica). My main research interests involve the study of symmetry-preserving QML for High-Energy Physics applications, like tagging, anomaly detection, etc. I'm also interested in quantum optimization problems.

GitHub projects
======
- [Aprendizado de M√°quina Qu√¢ntica](https://github.com/jogisuda/Aprendizado-de-Maquina-Quantica): This is the first Brazilian book about QML, fully written in Portuguese, for free, and publicly available for the community. Enjoy!
- [Quantum Sentence Transformer](https://github.com/jogisuda/QuantumSentenceTransformer): This project aims to shed light on Quantum Natural Language Processing. The model leverages parametrized circuits and [hybrid classical-quantum transfer learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08278) to come up with meaningful sentence representations. All code uses Pennylane and Sentence Transformers.
- [Discrete Path Transform](https://github.com/jogisuda/Discrete-Path-Transform): code for the DPT, developed jointly with the Signal Processing lab at UNESP.
- [ParaconsistentLIB](https://github.com/jogisuda/paraconsistentLIB) - paraconsistent logic-based feature engineering.
- [pyGAMESS-DS](https://github.com/jogisuda/pyGAMESS-DS) - automated retrieval of main molecular informations from GAMESS-US, like geometry-optimized coordinates, Gibbs energy corrections, net charges, etc.
