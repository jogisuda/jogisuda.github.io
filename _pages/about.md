I am a MSc student at the São Paulo State University (UNESP), and also working with Deep Learning at CK-12 Foundation, with focus on multimodal representation learning and Natural Language Processing.

Academic bio
======
My current research focuses on Quantum Computing for biomedical applications. Specifically, my work focuses on detecting parkinsonian speech using Quantum Neural Networks, considering both classical and also nonlinear measures from speech.

Recently, I've become very interested in Geometric Deep Learning for Quantum Computing, and a big topic for me is explaining how quantum models exploit Geometric priors in data from the viewpoint of groups and symmetries. I'm also interested in Deep Learning research in general.
