I'm a Physics PhD student at CERN. My main research interests involve the study of symmetry-preserving quantum machine learning for particle physics, graph models for tagging, anomaly detection, etc. I'm also interested in quantum optimization problems. I also wrote the first Brazilian book about QML, free and publicly available.

GitHub projects
======
- [Quantum Sentence Transformer](https://github.com/jogisuda/QuantumSentenceTransformer): This project aims to shed light on Quantum Natural Language Processing. The model leverages parametrized circuits and [hybrid classical-quantum transfer learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08278) to come up with meaningful sentence representations. All code uses Pennylane and Sentence Transformers.
- [Discrete Path Transform](https://github.com/jogisuda/Discrete-Path-Transform): code for the DPT, developed jointly with the Signal Processing lab at UNESP.
- [ParaconsistentLIB](https://github.com/jogisuda/paraconsistentLIB) - paraconsistent logic-based feature engineering.
- [pyGAMESS-DS](https://github.com/jogisuda/pyGAMESS-DS) - automated retrieval of main molecular informations from GAMESS-US, like geometry-optimized coordinates, Gibbs energy corrections, net charges, etc.
