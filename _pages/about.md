I'm a MSc student at S√£o Paulo State University (UNESP) & Machine Learning R&D Engineer at CK-12 Foundation.

Academic bio
======
I'm very interested on the mathematical foundations of Geometric Deep Learning & Quantum Machine Learning. In my research, I'm developing an equivariant quantum neural network, and I'm also very interested in its applications to physics problems that may benefit from the shared symmetrics priors as inductive biases. I am very honored to be advised by Prof. [Rodrigo Capobianco Guido](https://www.ibilce.unesp.br/#!/departamentos/cienc-comp-estatistica/docentes/rodrigo-capobianco-guido/) and Prof. [Felipe Fanchini](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vMzT1bUAAAAJ), both of which have greatly helped me grow in my path.

Before this, I graduated in 2019 as a Bachelor in Computer Science at UNESP, and in my dissertation I used [Paraconsistent Feature Engineering](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8588433) and Machine Learning for the development of a novel index for diagnosis of Keratoconus - both clinical and subclinical.

GitHub projects
======
- [Quantum Sentence Transformer](https://github.com/jogisuda/QuantumSentenceTransformer): This project aims to shed light on Quantum Natural Language Processing. The model leverages parametrized circuits and [hybrid classical-quantum transfer learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08278) to come up with meaningful sentence representations. All code uses Pennylane and Sentence Transformers.
- [Discrete Path Transform](https://github.com/jogisuda/Discrete-Path-Transform): code for the DPT, developed jointly with the Signal Processing lab at UNESP.
- [ParaconsistentLIB](https://github.com/jogisuda/paraconsistentLIB) - paraconsistent logic-based feature engineering.
- [pyGAMESS-DS](https://github.com/jogisuda/pyGAMESS-DS) - automated retrieval of main molecular informations from GAMESS-US, like geometry-optimized coordinates, Gibbs energy corrections, net charges, etc.
