I'm a Computer Scientist with a MSc at the S√£o Paulo State University (UNESP), where I studied Quantum Machine Learning (QML). Professionally, I also work as a Machine Learning R&D Engineer at the CK-12 Foundation.

Academic bio & interests
======
As an undergrad, I first started working with classical ML for keratoconus subclinical detection. In my masters, I moved on to QML, still motivated by the medical field - I showed how quantum models can be used to detect Parkinson's disease through the speech. After this, I progressively grew interest in the idea of group-equivariant/invariant QML. If you wonder what that is, think of the classical case of CNNs: we know that kernel parameter sharing naturally causes translation equivariance, while pooling gives invariance. We now have the same for parameterized quantum circuits: this area is being known as Geometric QML (GQML)... and it is very exciting! After all, which kinds of symmetries may be naturally incorporated into quantum models, showcasing a better inductive bias over classical architectures? Although we don't have an exact answer, there is an exciting, and potential application for this: Particle Physics! 

I am very honored to have been advised by both Prof. [Rodrigo Capobianco Guido](https://www.ibilce.unesp.br/#!/departamentos/cienc-comp-estatistica/docentes/rodrigo-capobianco-guido/) and Prof. [Felipe Fanchini](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vMzT1bUAAAAJ), both of which have greatly helped me grow in my path.

GitHub projects
======
- [Quantum Sentence Transformer](https://github.com/jogisuda/QuantumSentenceTransformer): This project aims to shed light on Quantum Natural Language Processing. The model leverages parametrized circuits and [hybrid classical-quantum transfer learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08278) to come up with meaningful sentence representations. All code uses Pennylane and Sentence Transformers.
- [Discrete Path Transform](https://github.com/jogisuda/Discrete-Path-Transform): code for the DPT, developed jointly with the Signal Processing lab at UNESP.
- [ParaconsistentLIB](https://github.com/jogisuda/paraconsistentLIB) - paraconsistent logic-based feature engineering.
- [pyGAMESS-DS](https://github.com/jogisuda/pyGAMESS-DS) - automated retrieval of main molecular informations from GAMESS-US, like geometry-optimized coordinates, Gibbs energy corrections, net charges, etc.
