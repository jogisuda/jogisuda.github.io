I am a MSc student at the S√£o Paulo State University (UNESP), and also working with Deep Learning at the CK-12 Foundation, with focus on multimodal representation learning and Natural Language Processing.

Academic bio
======
My current research focuses on Quantum Computing for biomedical applications. Specifically, my work focuses on detecting parkinsonian speech using Quantum Neural Networks, considering both classical and also nonlinear measures from speech.

Recently, I've become very interested in Geometric Deep Learning for Quantum Computing, specifically on understanding how quantum models exploit Geometric priors in data from the viewpoint of groups and symmetries. Other areas of interest for me are Graphs Neural Networks & Multimodal Representation Learning.

GitHub projects
======
- [Quantum Sentence Transformer](https://github.com/jogisuda/QuantumSentenceTransformer): This project aims to shed light on Quantum Natural Language Processing. The model leverages parametrized circuits and [hybrid classical-quantum transfer learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08278) to come up with meaningful sentence representations. All code uses Pennylane and Sentence Transformers.
- [Discrete Path Transform](https://github.com/jogisuda/Discrete-Path-Transform): code for the DPT, developed jointly with the Signal Processing lab at UNESP.
- [ParaconsistentLIB](https://github.com/jogisuda/paraconsistentLIB) - paraconsistent logic-based feature engineering.
- [pyGAMESS-DS](https://github.com/jogisuda/pyGAMESS-DS) - automated retrieval of main molecular informations from GAMESS-US, like geometry-optimized coordinates, Gibbs energy corrections, net charges, etc.
